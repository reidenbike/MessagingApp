# MessagingApp
Super awesome messaging app. But actually very much a rough draft at the moment.

**Important: When testing as the default messaging application on a real device, be aware that you will not receive any MMS messages until that part of the project is complete!! So people might wonder why you aren't responding to them...**

NOTE: Gradle issue with flexbox causing errors after pulling down from GitHub. Current fix is to cut line, sync, and place line back in again
